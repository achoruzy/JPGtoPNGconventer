# JPGtoPNGconventer
v. 0.1

Simple JPG to PNG conventer to use from cmd level.
Done as a simple exercise for my ZTM course contribution.

To work you need to type in cmd:
python main.py file_path_from filepath_to format_to

Code written entirely by me with no help from the course video and with big help from Sensei Google.
